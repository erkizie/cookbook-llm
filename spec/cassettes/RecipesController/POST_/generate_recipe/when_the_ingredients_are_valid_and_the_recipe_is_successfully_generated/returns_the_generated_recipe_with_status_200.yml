        is a simple recipe for Chicken and Rice using the ingredients you provided:\n\nIngredients:\n\n*
        1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs\n* 1 cup uncooked white
        rice\n* Salt, to taste\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Rinse the rice under cold water
        until the water runs clear. This helps to remove excess starch and prevent
        the rice from sticking together.\n\n2. Place the rice in a saucepan and add
        2 cups of water. Bring the water to a boil over high heat.\n\n3. Once the
        water is boiling, reduce the heat to low and cover the saucepan. Allow the
        rice to simmer for 18-20 minutes, or until all the water is absorbed and the
        rice is cooked through.\n\n4. While the rice is cooking, cut the chicken into
        bite-sized pieces.\n\n5. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add a
        small amount of oil to the skillet, then add the chicken. Cook the chicken
        for 5-7 minutes, or until it is cooked through and no longer pink in the middle.\n\n6.
        Season the chicken with salt to taste.\n\n7. Once the rice is cooked, fluff
        it with a fork and add it to the skillet with the chicken. Stir to combine
        and allow the rice and chicken to cook together for a minute or two.\n\n8.
        Taste and adjust the seasoning with more salt if needed. Serve hot.\n\nOptional:
        You can add other ingredients to this recipe to give it more flavor, such

        garlic, chopped bell peppers, frozen peas and carrots, or a sprinkle of paprika
