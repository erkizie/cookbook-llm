        here''s a simple and delicious recipe for chicken and rice:\n\nIngredients:\n\n*
        1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs, cut into bite-sized
        pieces\n* 1 cup uncooked long-grain white rice\n* 2 cups low-sodium chicken
        broth\n* 1 cup water\n* 1 onion, chopped\n* 2 cloves garlic, minced\n* 1 bell
        pepper, chopped (optional)\n* 1 carrot, chopped (optional)\n* 2 tablespoons
        olive oil\n* 1 teaspoon paprika\n* 1 teaspoon dried oregano\n* 1 teaspoon
        dried thyme\n* Salt and pepper, to taste\n* Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.
        Heat the olive oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.
        Add the chicken and cook until browned on all sides, about 5-7 minutes. Remove
        the chicken from the skillet and set aside.\n2. Add the chopped onion, garlic,
        bell pepper, and carrot (if using) to the skillet. Cook until the vegetables
        are softened and fragrant, about 3-5 minutes.\n3. Add the paprika, oregano,
        thyme, salt, and pepper to the skillet. Stir to combine and cook for 1 minute.\n4.
        Add the rice to the skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently,
        until the rice is lightly toasted.\n5. Add the chicken broth and water to
        the skillet, stirring to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the
        skillet.\n6. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and
        simmer, covered, for 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and has absorbed
        most of the liquid.\n7. Add the chicken back to the skillet and stir to combine.
        Cook for an additional 5 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.\n8.
        Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed.\n9. Serve the chicken and rice hot,
        garnished with chopped fresh parsley.\n\nEnjoy!"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"queue_time":0.028211276,"prompt_tokens":16,"prompt_time":0.002174264,"completion_tokens":498,"completion_time":0.80059249,"total_tokens":514,"total_time":0.802766754},"system_fingerprint":"fp_c5f20b5bb1","x_groq":{"id":"req_01jgvd5r26fyntwtys79s46j0m"}}
