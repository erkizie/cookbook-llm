        here''s a simple and delicious recipe for chicken and rice that you can try:\n\nIngredients:\n\n*
        1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces\n*
        1 cup uncooked long-grain white rice\n* 2 tablespoons olive oil\n* 1 medium
        onion, diced\n* 3 cloves garlic, minced\n* 1 red or green bell pepper, diced\n*
        1 (14.5 oz) can diced tomatoes, undrained\n* 2 cups chicken broth\n* 1 teaspoon
        paprika\n* 1 teaspoon dried oregano\n* 1/2 teaspoon salt\n* 1/4 teaspoon black
        pepper\n* 1/2 cup frozen peas\n* Optional toppings: chopped fresh cilantro
        or parsley, sour cream, shredded cheese\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Heat the olive
        oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the chicken
        and cook until browned, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the chicken from the skillet
        and set it aside.\n2. Add the diced onion to the skillet and cook until softened,
        about 3-4 minutes. Add the minced garlic and diced bell pepper and cook for
        another 2-3 minutes, until the pepper is starting to soften.\n3. Add the rice
        to the skillet and stir to coat it with the oil and vegetables. Cook for 1-2
        minutes, until the rice starts to brown slightly.\n4. Add the diced tomatoes,
        chicken broth, paprika, oregano, salt, and black pepper to the skillet. Stir
        to combine.\n5. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low,
        cover, and simmer for 15-20 minutes, until the rice is cooked and most of
        the liquid has been absorbed.\n6. Stir in the frozen peas and add the chicken
        back to the skillet. Cook for another 5-10 minutes, until the peas are heated
        through and the chicken is cooked through.\n7. Serve the chicken and rice
        hot, with your choice of toppings.\n\nEnjoy!"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"queue_time":0.029448942,"prompt_tokens":16,"prompt_time":0.002157184,"completion_tokens":500,"completion_time":0.795716733,"total_tokens":516,"total_time":0.797873917},"system_fingerprint":"fp_c5f20b5bb1","x_groq":{"id":"req_01jgvjhec6fcbrk2prw0ea9k8p"}}
