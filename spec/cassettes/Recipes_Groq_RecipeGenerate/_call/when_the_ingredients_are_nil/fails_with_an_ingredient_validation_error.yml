        pepper, sliced\n* 1 yellow bell pepper, sliced\n* 1 medium onion, sliced\n*
        2 cloves of garlic, minced\n* 1 tablespoon of fresh ginger, grated\n* 2 carrots,
        sliced\n* 1 zucchini, sliced\n* 1 cup of snap peas\n* 1/4 cup of unsalted

        tablespoons of rice vinegar\n* 1 tablespoon of sesame oil\n* 1 tablespoon

        2 tablespoons of honey\n* 1/4 cup of water\n* Fresh cilantro, chopped (optional)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.
        Cut the tofu into bite-sized cubes and set aside.\n2. Heat 1 tablespoon of
        olive oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the tofu and
        cook until browned on all sides, about 5-7 minutes. Remove from the skillet
        and set aside.\n3. Add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to the skillet.
        Add the bell peppers, onion, garlic, and ginger, and cook for 2-3 minutes
        until softened.\n4. Add the carrots, zucchini, and snap peas to the skillet.
        Cook for an additional 5 minutes, stirring frequently.\n5. While the vegetables
        are cooking, make the peanut sauce. In a small bowl, whisk together the soy
        sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil, sriracha sauce, peanut butter, honey, and
        water until smooth.\n6. Add the cooked tofu back into the skillet with the
        vegetables. Pour the peanut sauce over the top and stir to coat everything
        evenly.\n7. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until everything is heated
        through and the sauce has thickened slightly.\n8. Season with salt and pepper,
        to taste. Sprinkle with chopped peanuts and fresh cilantro, if desired.\n9.
        Serve immediately over rice or noodles.
