        here''s a simple recipe for chicken and rice using just those three ingredients:\n\nIngredients:\n\n*
        1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs\n* 1 cup uncooked white
        rice\n* Salt, to taste\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Rinse the rice in a fine mesh
        strainer and set aside.\n2. Season the chicken on both sides with salt to
        taste.\n3. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. When the skillet is
        hot, add the chicken and cook for 3-4 minutes per side, or until the chicken
        is browned on both sides and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the skillet
        and set it aside.\n4. Add the rinsed rice to the same skillet, and cook over
        medium heat for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently, until the rice is lightly
        toasted.\n5. Pour 2 cups of water into the skillet, and bring to a boil. Reduce
        the heat to low, cover the skillet, and let the rice simmer for 15-20 minutes,
        or until the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked.\n6. While the rice
        is cooking, chop the cooked chicken into bite-sized pieces.\n7. When the rice
        is cooked, fluff it with a fork and stir in the chopped chicken. Taste and
        adjust the seasoning with more salt if needed.\n8. Serve the chicken and rice
        hot, garnished with your choice of herbs, vegetables or sauces, if desired.
        Enjoy!"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"queue_time":0.030581124,"prompt_tokens":26,"prompt_time":0.002543853,"completion_tokens":341,"completion_time":0.544496784,"total_tokens":367,"total_time":0.547040637},"system_fingerprint":"fp_c5f20b5bb1","x_groq":{"id":"req_01jgvjhhmse309bctdvqznyzk9"}}
