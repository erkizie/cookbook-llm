        here''s a simple recipe for chicken and rice using those ingredients:\n\nIngredients:\n\n*
        1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs\n* 1 cup long-grain white
        rice\n* 1 teaspoon salt (plus more to taste)\n* 2 cups water\n* 2 tablespoons
        olive oil\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces and
        season with a pinch of salt.\n2. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over
        medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook until browned on all sides, about
        5-7 minutes.\n3. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.\n4. Add
        the rice to the skillet and cook, stirring constantly, until lightly toasted,
        about 2-3 minutes.\n5. Add the water and 1 teaspoon of salt to the skillet.
        Stir to combine and bring to a boil.\n6. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and
        let the rice simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the water is absorbed and
        the rice is tender.\n7. Fluff the rice with a fork and stir in the cooked
        chicken.\n8. Taste and adjust the seasoning with more salt if needed.\n9.
        Serve hot and enjoy!\n\nOptional variations:\nYou can add other ingredients
        such as diced onions, garlic, bell peppers, or chopped herbs like parsley
        or cilantro to the skillet when cooking the rice for extra flavor. You can
        also stir in some shredded cheese at the end for a cheesy twist."},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"queue_time":0.026668546,"prompt_tokens":26,"prompt_time":0.003483231,"completion_tokens":365,"completion_time":0.586405648,"total_tokens":391,"total_time":0.589888879},"system_fingerprint":"fp_c5f20b5bb1","x_groq":{"id":"req_01jgvd5w8fe8z97ed8bg2vqxae"}}
