        here''s a simple recipe for chicken and rice using just those ingredients:\n\nIngredients:\n\n*
        1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs\n* 1 cup uncooked white
        rice\n* Salt, to taste\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Rinse the chicken and pat it
        dry with paper towels. Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces.\n2. Heat a
        large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken to the skillet and cook
        until it is browned on all sides and cooked through, about 5-7 minutes.\n3.
        While the chicken is cooking, rinse the rice in a fine-mesh strainer under
        cold running water.\n4. When the chicken is cooked, remove it from the skillet
        and set it aside on a plate.\n5. In the same skillet, add the rinsed rice
        and stir it around for a minute or two to toast it slightly.\n6. Add 2 cups
        of water to the skillet and stir to combine with the rice. Bring the water
        to a boil.\n7. Once the water is boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the
        skillet, and let the rice simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until it has absorbed
        all of the water and is fully cooked.\n8. Fluff the cooked rice with a fork
        and add the cooked chicken back into the skillet. Stir to combine.\n9. Season
        the chicken and rice with salt, to taste.\n10. Serve hot and enjoy!\n\nOptional
        variations:\nYou can add other ingredients to this basic recipe to give it
        more flavor. Here are a few ideas:\n\n* Add some chopped onions or garlic
        to the skillet when you cook the chicken.\n* Stir in some chopped vegetables,
        such as bell peppers, carrots, or peas, when you add the chicken back into
        the skillet.\n* Sprinkle some dried herbs, such as thyme or rosemary, over
        the rice and chicken before serving.\n* Drizzle some olive oil or butter over
        the cooked rice and chicken for added richness."},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"queue_time":0.028065084,"prompt_tokens":26,"prompt_time":0.002896152,"completion_tokens":467,"completion_time":0.745545101,"total_tokens":493,"total_time":0.748441253},"system_fingerprint":"fp_c5f20b5bb1","x_groq":{"id":"req_01jgrsbeb8e67ssjsj97hjf7p4"}}
