        Simple Chicken and Rice\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 4 chicken breasts\n* 2 cups of
        rice\n* Salt, to taste\n\nInstructions:\n\nStep 1: Gather all the ingredients
        and cooking equipment\nMake sure you have all the necessary ingredients and
        cooking equipment. You will need:\n\n* A cutting board\n* A sharp knife\n*
        A large skillet or frying pan with a lid\n* Measuring cups\n* A spatula or
        wooden spoon\n* A pot for cooking rice\n\nStep 2: Prepare the chicken\nPlace
        the chicken breasts on the cutting board. Trim off any excess fat and cut
        the chicken into bite-sized pieces. Season the chicken pieces with salt, to
        taste.\n\nStep 3: Cook the chicken\nHeat the skillet or frying pan over medium
        heat. Add a small amount of oil (if desired) and cook the chicken pieces until
        they are cooked through and no longer pink in the middle. Once cooked, remove
        the chicken from the skillet and set it aside.\n\nStep 4: Cook the rice\nWhile
        the chicken is cooking, start preparing the rice. Rinse the rice in a fine-mesh
        strainer under cold water until the water runs clear. This helps to remove
        excess starch and prevent the rice from becoming too sticky. In a pot, combine
        the rinsed rice with 4 cups of water and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Bring the water
        to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover the pot. Allow the rice to
        simmer for 18-20 minutes, or until all the water is absorbed and the rice
        is tender.\n\nStep 5: Combine the cooked chicken and rice\nOnce both the chicken
        and rice are cooked, combine them in the skillet or frying pan. Stir gently
        to combine the ingredients and warm everything through. Taste and adjust the
        seasoning with additional salt, if necessary.\n\nStep 6: Serve and enjoy\nDivide
        the chicken and rice mixture among plates and serve hot. You can garnish with
        chopped herbs, such as parsley or cilantro, for added flavor and color. Enjoy
        your simple and delicious meal!"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"queue_time":0.030329817000000002,"prompt_tokens":26,"prompt_time":0.002566722,"completion_tokens":479,"completion_time":0.765399246,"total_tokens":505,"total_time":0.767965968},"system_fingerprint":"fp_c5f20b5bb1","x_groq":{"id":"req_01jgvjhjgsej297mra39er3wgz"}}
